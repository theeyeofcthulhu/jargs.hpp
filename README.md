# jargs.hpp - C++ command-line argument parser

Command-line argument parser with support for long options and generating help pages.

This is a "single-header" library, meaning you need only include the one header in your project and *in one file* include the implementation:

```cpp
#define JARGS_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "jargs.hpp"
```

## Usage

See files `example.cpp` and `example2.cpp`
